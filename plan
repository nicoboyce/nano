Opening Image

Pub quiz mastering? Winning a quiz show? doing a crossword?

Theme Stated

Offhand remark to the main character which he disagrees with and only later comes to understand

sometimes the obvious solution is the right one? You don't always need to overcomplicate your problems - some problems 
are just complicated

Set-up

Introduce all A story characters (or hint at them eg Edward) Six things that need fixing - call-backs etc - Norm is 
somewhat antisocial, spends a lot of time alone but never at peace. Socks keep disappearing. Am I going mad?

Catalyst

1 down - Norm arrives for his pub quiz but the pub is burned down. What does the mysterious scrawl across the still smouldering door represent? One down...how many to go?

Debate

Norm has never come across a puzzle he couldn't solve - but what could the arsonist's next target be?
