## Chapter 1 (2000)

Blinking in the harsh studio lighting, Norman winced as an intern on a scaffold lobbed handfulls of glittery confetti over him as Sandi Toksvig delivered a piece to camera. Another naff trophy to sit on his fireplace mantel - Fifteen to One champion 2016. Barely remembering the deciding question, hardly aware of his voice as he spoke the crucial answer, Norman nevertheless consciously chose to absorb the following moment, wave after wave of joy, relief, satisfaction.

The runner up reached over to shake his hand - slightly too firmly, slightly too muscular a shake. Norman was never too keen on physical contact, not one for sports either, except perhaps from a trivia perspective - who else could recite the key facts of every Ashes test? Or the podium positions of every Grand Prix since the seventies, and he was working on memorising that decade too.

No, second place man Edward (first loser, thought Norman) wasn't the usual quizzing type, a bit too healthy, a bit too toned and groomed, a bit too business like. Did he find the joy in knowledge or in the competitive nature of puzzles and trivia? Either way, he had today fallen short.

He leaned back on his stool, glanced around the room for any cheaters desperately googling, took a sip of his cask stout. This was the moment he always enjoyed best, watching the punters agonize over the connections between tracks, the satisfaction of spotting the moment of recognition and then brief smug grin as some smartarse joined the dots.

Manowar followed - their orchestral take on heavy metal being some way out of the comfort zone of the Monday night crowd at the Notte Inn. Norman took a deep breath, soaking up the atmosphere. He had hosted the quiz night here for the better part of a decade now, with the odd interruption. He knew he was something of an attraction for the pub - few if any can boast of a Mastermind and Fifteen to One champion host for their weekly dose of brain teasers.

As the music round continued, Norman (Norm to everyone else, though never he never tolerated the contraction to his face) spotted
