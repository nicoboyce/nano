## Chapter 1 (2000)

Blinking in the harsh studio lighting, Norman winced as an intern on a scaffold lobbed handfulls of glittery confetti over him as John Humphreys delivered a piece to camera. Another naff trophy to sit on his fireplace mantel - a glass bowl carefully etched with the words "Mastermind champion 2016" - but a fine triumph over the disorder of the unknown fact. Barely remembering the deciding question, hardly aware of his voice as he spoke the crucial answer, Norman nevertheless consciously chose to absorb the following moment, wave after wave of joy, relief, satisfaction.

The runner up reached over to shake his hand - slightly too firmly, slightly too muscular a shake. Norman was never too keen on physical contact, not one for sports either, except perhaps from a trivia perspective - who else could recite the key facts of every Ashes test? Or the podium positions of every Grand Prix since the seventies, and he was working on memorising that decade too.

No, second place man Edward (first loser, thought Norman) wasn't the usual quizzing type, a bit too healthy, a bit too toned and groomed, a bit too business like. Did he find the joy in knowledge or in the competitive nature of puzzles and trivia? Either way, he had today fallen short.

*Theme*

Norman knew the routine from here, wave at the studio audience, be whisked off backstage for a few more questions about his home life and motivations, a couple of photos holding the perpex lump soon to be collecting dust back in Swindon. Then a taxi for one along the M4 (cheers, license payers) and perhaps a glass of something black as night. Perhaps he'd crack open one of his special occasion stouts, Siren or Wild Beer, put his feet up and do the crossword. Yes, that sounds lovely.

His end terrace abode was arranged such that the dining room was at the front of the house, with a sturdy oak table almost lost beneath newspaper cuttings and Norman's self compiled fact sheets. Norman bypassed the mess, the stacks of books and magazines reaching almost the ceiling in many cases, heading directly for the old brown leather Chesterfield armchair in which he could usually be expected to be located of an evening.

Norm's local pub is burned down but a mysterious scrawl across the still smouldering door reads "one down"

With a satisfying thunk, Norman's trusty Panasonic began to spool the casette tape and blasted out a snippet of Iggy Pop through the packed pub. He leaned back on his stool, glanced around the room for any cheaters desperately googling, took a sip of his cask stout. This was the moment he always enjoyed best, watching the punters agonize over the connections between tracks, the satisfaction of spotting the moment of recognition and then brief smug grin as some smartarse joined the dots.

Manowar followed - their orchestral take on heavy metal being some way out of the comfort zone of the Monday night crowd at the Notte Inn. Norman took a deep breath, soaking up the atmosphere. He had hosted the quiz night here for the better part of a decade now, with the odd interruption. He knew he was something of an attraction for the pub - few if any can boast of a Mastermind and Fifteen to One champion host for their weekly dose of brain teasers.

As the music round continued, Norman (Norm to everyone else, though never he never tolerated the contraction to his face) spotted
